Expense Categorization: The system provides predefined categories (such as Food, Rent, Utilities, etc.), and users can also add custom categories as needed.

Expense Reports: Generate reports for weekly, monthly, or custom periods to monitor spending patterns.

Budgeting: Set budget limits for specific categories and get notified when limits are exceeded.

User Access Management: Different family members can be granted varying levels of access to enter data, view reports, or manage categories.
